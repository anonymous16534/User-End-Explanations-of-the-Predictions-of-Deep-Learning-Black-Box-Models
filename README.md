# User-End-Explanations-of-the-Predictions-of-Deep-Learning-Black-Box-Models

This repository is a primary version of the source code and models of the paper Generating Deep Learning Model-Specific Explanations at the End User's Side. 
The repository uses PyTorch to implement the experiments and provides the scripts explaining the Black box models locally on the user side by training a local surrogate model. 

## Content
The repository contains three folders, each one is for the training and explaining a different data set, In each folder all the necessary notebooks are included, to train the provider model, the local surrogate model, and to generate the explanations using the counterfactual examples.

## Dependencies

[Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

[PyTorch 1.6](https://pytorch.org/)
